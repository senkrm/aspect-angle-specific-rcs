This is the repository for supplementary materials of the paper "Dynamic_RCS_Modeling_and_Aspect_Angle_Analysis_for_High_Maneuverable_UAVs". 
Including:
1. RCS simulation script and 3D model (rcs_sim.m and f-16.stl)
2. Aspect angle calculation script (global_rect_to_loc_sph.m)
3. Flight characteristics visualisation script (flight_characteristics.m)
4. Script for the integration of RCS data and aspect angle (data_integration)

Scripts are verified on MATLAB R2024a

Flight dataset with 6DoF are also included.
